Web Application

These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

	(i) Scripting Language

		These are the languages, that which are interpreted, during runtime they takes lot of time to execute. 

	(ii) Programming Langauge

		These are the languages, that which are compiled first, so during runtime they takes very less time to execute. 

In web applications we can implement 

(i) Client-Side Scripting

	Enables you to access the application from same system

	No Network Traffic

	Execution will be faster

(ii) Server-Side Scripting 


	Enables you to access the application from the server
	
	Network traffic is high

	A bit slower 

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No security please opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min. Security please opt for both client-side and server-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High security please opt for server-side scripting ***
