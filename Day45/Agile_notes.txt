Waterfall Model : 

-> All the requirements needs to be defined at first

-> No new requirements or changes to be added in the middle 

-> You cannot review the product till end, then there may be some strange results 

-> Whenever we dont have strict timelines then we need to proceed for waterfall model

Product Owner

A Product Owner is the one who drives the product from business perspective. The responsibilities or a Product Owner are as follows −

	•	To define the requirements and prioritize their values.
	•	To determine the release date and contents.
	•	To take an active role in iteration planning and release planning meetings.
•	To ensure that team is working on the most valued requirement.
•	To represent the voice of the customer.
•	To accept the user stories that meet the definition of done and defined acceptance criteria.

What is a User Story?
A user story is a requirement which defines what is required by the user as functionality. A user story can be in two forms −
•	As a <User Role> I want <Functionality> so that <Business Value>
•	In order to <Business value> as a <User Role> I want <Functionality>
		During release planning, a rough estimate is given to a user story using relative scale as 			points. During iteration planning, the story is broken down into tasks.


•	User story talks about what is to be done. It defines what a user needs.
•	Task talks about how it is to be done. It defines how a functionality is to be implemented.
•	Stories are implemented by tasks. Each story is a collection of tasks.
•	User story is divided into tasks when it is planned in current iteration.
•	Tasks are estimated in hours, typically from 2 to 12 hours.
•	Stories are validated using acceptance tests.

When a Story is Done
The team decides what done means. The criteria may be −
•	All tasks (development, testing) are completed.
•	All acceptance tests are running and are passed.
•	No defect is open.
•	Product owner has accepted the story.
•	Deliverable to the end-user.


What is Acceptance Criteria?

Criteria defines the functionality, behavior, and performance required by a feature so that it can be accepted by the product owner. It defines what is to be done so that the developer knows when a user story is complete.


What is sprint : 

Each iteration in agile process known as sprint. 

Spring iteration review to be happend atleast once in a week

compulsory one time in 4 weeks. 

Twelve Principles of Agile Manifesto
•	Customer Satisfaction − Highest priority is given to satisfy the requirements of customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

•	Welcome Change − Changes are inevitable during software development. Ever-changing requirements should be welcome, even late in the development phase. Agile processes should work to increase customers' competitive advantage.

•	Deliver a Working Software − Deliver a working software frequently, ranging from a few weeks to a few months, considering shorter time-scale.

•	Collaboration − Business people and developers must work together during the entire life of a project.

•	Motivation − Projects should be built around motivated individuals. Provide an environment to support individual team members and trust them so as to make them feel responsible to get the job done.

•	Face-to-face Conversation − Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team.

•	Measure the Progress as per the Working Software − Working software is the key and it should be the primary measure of progress.

•	Maintain Constant Pace − Agile processes aim towards sustainable development. The business, the developers, and the users should be able to maintain a constant pace with the project.

•	Monitoring − Pay regular attention to technical excellence and good design to enhance agility.

•	Simplicity − Keep things simple and use simple terms to measure the work that is not completed.

•	Self-organized Teams − An agile team should be self-organized and should not depend heavily on other teams because the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organized teams.

•	Review the Work Regularly − Review the work done at regular intervals so that the team can reflect on how to become more effective and adjust its behavior accordingly.


Validation always goes with product

Verification always goes with process

What is Daily Stand-up?
•	A daily stand-up is a daily status meeting among all team members and it is held roughly for 15 minutes.
•	Every member has to answer three important questions −
o	What I did yesterday?
o	What I'll do today?
o	Any impediment I am facing.../ I am blocked due to...
•	Daily stand-up is for status update, not for any discussion. For discussion, team members should schedule another meeting at a different time.
•	Participants usually stand instead of sitting so that the meeting gets over quickly.

•	The team can evaluate the progress on a daily basis and see if they can deliver as per the iteration plan.
•	Each team member informs all about his/ her commitments for the day.
•	It provides visibility to the team on any delay or obstacles.

User Story
A user story is a requirement which is formulated in a few sentences in everyday language of an user and it should be completed within an iteration. A user story is done when
•	All the related code have been checked-in.
•	All the unit test cases have been passed.
•	All the acceptance test cases have been passed.
•	Help text is written.
•	Product Owner has accepted the story.

An iteration is also termed as a sprint. An iteration is done when
•	Product backup is complete.
•	Performance has been tested.
•	User stories have been accepted or moved to the next iteration.
•	Defects have been fixed or postponed to the next iteration.

Once sprint created, it will not be modified in the middle, 

new requirements to be added to the next sprint only. 

A release is a major milestone that represents an internal or external delivery of working, tested version of the product/system. A release is done when

•	System is stress tested.
•	Performance is tuned.
•	Security validations are carried out.
•	Disaster recovery plan is tested.

The purpose of release planning is to create a plan to deliver an increment to the product. It is done after every 2 to 3 months.

Who is Involved?
•	Scrum Master − The scrum master acts as a facilitator for the agile delivery team.
•	Product Owner − The product owner represents the general view of the product backlog.
•	Agile Team − Agile delivery team provides insights on the technical feasibilities or any dependencies.
•	Stakeholders − Stakeholders like customers, progWho is Involved?
•	Scrum Master − The scrum master acts as a facilitator for the agile delivery team.
•	Product Owner − The product owner deals with the detailed view of the product backlog and their acceptance criteria.
•	Agile Team − Agile delivery defines their tasks and sets the effort estimates required to fulfil the commitment.
ram managers, subject matter experts act as advisers as decisions are made around the release planning.
