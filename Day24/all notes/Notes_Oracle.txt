File System Drawbacks : 
________________________

1) No Security 

2) Data redundancy is high

3) Changes will not reflect in all places 

4) Creates multiple copies of data 

5) Not able to store different data polymorphisms. 

Database : 

A database is set of interrelated files, stored with min. redundancy to serve many users work concurrently. 

DBMS (Database Management System) 

    The software that which allows you to perform transactions on data like adding new data, modifying already existing data and removing unwanted data known as DBMS. 

Objectives : 
_____________

	1) Provides an efficient and convinient env, that which allows you to store the data in and retrieve data. 

	2) Granting access on data to users based on their credentials 

Drawbacks : 
___________

   1) Data Redundancy 

   2) Risk to Data Integrity 

   3) Data Isolation 

   4) Difficult Access to Data 

   5) Unsatisfactory Security Measures 

Data Model : It is the description of the org. of data in the database. It also describes the relationship among the data and any constraints that have to be defined on data. 


There are 2 types of data models known as 

1) Object-based logical Model : Focuses on describing the data, and the relationship among the data and any constraints defined. 

2) Record-based logical model : Focuses on describing the data structure and the access techniques in the DBMS. 

Object-baed Logical model : 

The ER model : It is based on the real world perception that comprises a collection of objects or entites and the relationships among the data. 

Entity : An entity is a thing, that which can be easily identified. 

Entities are represented using Rectangle symbol. 

Attribute : 

An attribute is a property of a given entity, 

Relationship : It is an association among various entities. There are 3 types of relationships known as 

   (i) One-One Relationship

  (ii) One-Many Relationship

 (iii) Many-Many Relationship 


Record Based Models : 

1) Hierarchical model : Data is represented in the form of tree, data in hierarchical model is represented by a collection of records and relationships between the data are represented by links. 

2) Network Model : similar to hierarchical model in the way that the data and the relationships among them are represented in the form of records and links. You can represent the records in the daabase graphically. 

3) Relational Model : A table in the database has fixed record length with fixed number of attributes or fields. 


The row in a table is called tuple and the column is called an attribute. Every column in the table must have a unique name, the no.of tuples is called the cardinality of the table, and the no.of attributes is called the degree of the table. 

The relational model is based on the principle of relational algebra. 

It is a collection of operators that operate on relationships.

Employ(Empno,Name,Dept,AadharNo,Desig,Gender,SalDate,Basic)

Candidate Key : 

Any attribute, that which uniquely identifies rows of a table known as candidate key. {Empno,AadharNo} 

One of the candidate key needs to be chosen as primary key based on priority.  

Any key that which is candidate key, but not primary key known as alternate key. (AadharNo)

Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of a table, made up of more than one attribute known as composite key. 

{Empno+SalDate}

Foreign Key : Primary key in the parent table will be foreign key in the child table. 

A relatinal system said to be truly relational if it satisfies 12 codd rules. 

1) Information Representation
 Ensure any data need to be represented in terms of rows and columns of tables.

2) Guaranteed Access 

Every data value in the relational database should be logically accessible by specifying a combination of the table name, the primary key value and the column name.

3) Systematic Treatment of NULL values

DBMS must allow NULL values to support missing or inapplicable info. They must be distinct from zero or spaces. 

4) Data Description Rule

The data in the database is the categorized in such a way that system catalog and user catlog. System catalog consists of system objects that are exist at the time of installation. User catalog contains objects that are to be created by the user during working with databases. 

The tables in both catalogs need to contain description and structure of database. These tables are created owned and maintained by the DBMS. Ensure you can give privileges to the tables, and system tables are read-only.

5) Comprehensive Data Sublanguage

This rule states that the system must support all the following functions : 

 1) Data Definition
 2) View Definition
 3) Data Manipulation operations
 4) Security and Integrity constraints
 5) Transaction Management Operations. 


6) View Updating 

7) High level Insert, Update and Delete 

Ensures that rows should be treated as sets in insert, update and delete operations.  IT stresses on the set-oriented nature of database. 

8) Physical Data Independence 

Application programs must remain unimpaired when any changes are made in the storage representation or access methods. 


9) Logical Data Independence 

Changes should not affect the user's ability to work with the data. 

10) Data Distribution Rule

Databases must allow manipulation of distributed data located on other computer system. 

11) Non-Subversion

States that different levels of the language cannot subvert or bypass the integrity rules and constraints.  The DBMS must ensure that no other level can bypass the constraints specified to maintain the integrity of the database. 

12) Integrity Rule 

Integrity constraints must be storable in the system catalog.

Joins : 

Joins are used to extract data from more than one table, there are different types of joins known as 

1) Inner Join : It acts as an INTERSECT operator, used to extract only the common records from the given table(s).

Subqueries : 
_____________

Sometimes it is not possible to extract data by using single sql statement, then we need the help of subqueries. A subquery is a query that which is having another query inside, the query which is inside known as inner query, the query which is outside known as outer query. Everytime, the result of the Inner query will be send as input to the outer query.

IF Subquery returns more than one value, then we have to use either ALL or ANY keywords.

ALL -> It acts as AND operator.

Empno <> ALL(10,20,30) means 

Empno <> 10 AND Empno <> 20 AND Empno<> 30

Empno <> ANY(10,20,30) means 

Empno <> 10 OR Empno <> 20 OR Empno <> 30

1) Display all Dname details from Dept, where deptno is there dept 
but not there in Emp 

select dname from Dept where Deptno !=ALL(select deptno from Emp);

2) Display all faculty details who teaches 'ora' 

select fcode,name,qual from faculty;

select fcode,ccode from course_faculty;

select fcode,name,qual from faculty
where fcode=ANY(select fcode from course_faculty
where ccode='ora');

select * from batches;

select * from faculty;


Display the details of batches handled by faculty name ‘George Koch’.

select * from batches
where fcode=(select fcode from faculty where lower(name)='george koch');

1) Display all batch details, whose QUAL is like MS OR
course fee > 5000;



select * from batches
where fcode in 
      (select  fcode from faculty where qual like '%MS%')
   or  ccode in
      ( select ccode from courses where fee > 5000);


Get the details of course that has highest course fee.

Display all course details whose fee is > course duration is 25 days 

select name from courses
where  fee > any ( select fee from courses where duration = 25);

Data Integrity : It is imp. to ensure that the data stored in tables is complete and consistent.  The concept of maintaining consistency and completeness of data is called data integrity.  It is enforced to ensure that the data in the database is accurate, consistent and reliable.  

1) Entity Integrity : Ensures that each row can be uniquely identified by an attribute called the primary key. The primary key column contains unique value in all the rows. This column cannot be NULL. 

2) Domain Integrity : Ensures that only a valid range of values is stored in a column. It can be enforced by restricting the type of data.  For suppose the dept field need to contain the list of values as 'computers' or 'physics' or 'maths' then it is coming under the part of domain integrity. 

3) Referential Integrity : Ensures that the values of the foreign key match the values of the corresponding primary key.
